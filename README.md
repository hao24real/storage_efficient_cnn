# Lightweight CNN Architectures for Image Classification

## Overview
This repository is home to my exploration of lightweight CNN architectures tailored for image classification tasks. It serves as a companion to the research paper, providing practical insights into CNN optimizations for models with restricted parameter budgets.

## Models
Included in this repo are several models:

- **Base Model**: The foundational model of our investigation.
- **Models V1-V6**: These are our experimental models, each incorporating unique architectural features.
- **Model Alpha**: The pinnacle of our experimentation, showcasing the combined learnings from previous models.

## Contribution
I encourage you to fork the repo, suggest enhancements, or utilize our models for your research. Collaboration is key to advancing the field.

## Contact
If you have questions or would like to discuss the research further, please reach out.
